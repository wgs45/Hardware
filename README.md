   - Bare-metal Programming
   - Wireless Communication (Bluetooth, Wi-Fi)

## Setup and Installation

To run the hardware programming projects in this repository, you may need specific hardware and software tools depending on the project. Below are general steps for getting started with common platforms like Arduino and Raspberry Pi.

### Arduino Setup

1. **Install Arduino IDE:**
   - Download and install the Arduino IDE from [arduino.cc](https://www.arduino.cc/en/software).

2. **Connect Arduino Board:**
   - Connect your Arduino board to your computer via USB.

3. **Upload Code:**
   - Open the Arduino IDE, open a project (.ino file), and click the upload button to upload the code to your Arduino board.

### Raspberry Pi Setup

1. **Install Raspbian OS:**
   - Download and install the Raspbian OS on your Raspberry Pi.

2. **GPIO Programming:**
   - Use Python or C/C++ libraries to control GPIO pins on the Raspberry Pi.

## Usage

Each project directory contains its own README or documentation file explaining how to set up and run the project. Follow the instructions provided to compile, upload, or run the code on your hardware platform.

## Contributing

Contributions are welcome! If you have any improvements, bug fixes, or new projects that you would like to add, please follow these steps:

1. Fork the repository
2. Create a new branch (`git checkout -b feature-branch`)
3. Commit your changes (`git commit -am 'Add new feature'`)
4. Push to the branch (`git push origin feature-branch`)
5. Create a new Pull Request

Please ensure that your code adheres to the existing coding standards and includes appropriate documentation.
